  <h2>How to use the API </h2>
  <p>
    In order to consume some information from the API, we need to get a token by <a routerLink="/register"
    routerLinkActive="active">registering</a> in the application. The token enable us to have fully access to 
    the information stored. Indeed, the following table show us the operations and desirable results that our API 
    offers: 
  </p>
  <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>URL</th>
            <th>Operation</th>
            <th>Acess</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>/users</td>
        <td>PUT</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Register a user in the application. As a result, we obtain a user inforamtion including the token </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/users/login</td>
        <td>POST</td>
        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Login a user into the API (check if a user introduce a correct login)</td>

    This part of the documentation is focused on showing the inputs and outputs of each API operation. 
  </p>
  <h3>Register a User</h3>
  <p>For registering a user, we need to pass for the API a user with the username, email and password:</p> 
  <pre>
      <code class="json">
        "user":
          "email":"rick@afenews.io", 
          "password":"rick", 
          "username":"rick"
      </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    As a result, we obtain the complete user informatio including the token for being used in the application: 
  </p>
  <pre>
      <code class="json">
          "user": 
            "username": "rick",
            "email": "rick@afenews.io",
            "token": "SPECIFIC TOKEN HERE"
